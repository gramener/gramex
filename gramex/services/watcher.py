The file watch service uses `watchdog <https://pythonhosted.org/watchdog/>`_ to
monitor files, and run functions when the file changes.

# Terminology:
#   observer    - a single instance class that has all scheduler related behavior
#   watch       - an instance that watches a single *folder*
#   handler     - an instance that handles events - associated with a single *name*

# There's only one observer. Start it at the beginning and schedule stuff later
observer = Observer()
observer.start()
atexit.register(observer.stop)

handlers = {}               # (handler, watch) -> (folder, name)
watches = AttrDict()        # watches[folder] = ObservedWatch


class FileEventHandler(FileSystemEventHandler):
    '''
    Each FileEventHandler is associated with a set of events from a config.
    It maps a set of paths to these events.
    '''

            super(FileEventHandler, self).dispatch(event)


def watch(name, paths, **events):
    '''
    Watch one or more paths, and trigger an event function.

    Example::

        watch('test', ['test.txt'],
              on_modified: lambda event: logging.info('Modified test.txt'),
              on_created: lambda event: logging.info('Created test.txt'))

    When ``test.txt`` is modified or created, it logs one of the above messages.

    To replace the same handler with another, use the same ``name``::

        watch('test', ['test.txt'],
              on_deleted: lambda event: logging.info('Deleted test.txt'))

    Now, when ``test.txt`` is deleted, it logs a message. But when ``test.txt``
    is created or modified, no message is shown, since the old handler has been
    replaced.

    To remove this watch, call ``unwatch('test')``.

    :arg string name: Unique name of the watch.  To replace an existing watch,
        re-use the same name.
    :arg list paths: List of relative or absolute paths to watch.  The paths
        can be strings or ``pathlib.Path`` objects.
    :arg function on_modified(event): Called when any path is modified.
    :arg function on_created(event): Called when any path is created.
    :arg function on_deleted(event): Called when any path is deleted.
    :arg function on_moved(event): Called when any path is moved.
    :arg function on_any_event(event): Called on any of the above events.
