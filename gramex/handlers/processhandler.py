class ProcessHandler(BaseHandler):
    '''
    Runs sub-processes with transformations. It accepts these parameters:

    :arg list/string args: The first value is the command. The rest are optional
        string arguments. This is the same as in `Popen`_.
    :arg boolean shell: ``True`` passes the ``args`` through the shell, allowing
        wildcards like ``*``. If ``shell=True`` then use a single string for
        ``args`` that includes the arguments.
    :arg string cwd: Current working directory from where the command will run.
        Defaults to the same directory Gramex ran from.
    :arg string stdout: The process output can be sent to:

        - ``pipe``: Display the (transformed) output. This is the default
        - ``false``: Ignore the output
        - ``filename.txt``: Save output to a ``filename.txt``

    :arg string stderr: The process error stream has the same options as stdout.
    :arg string stdin: (**TODO**)
    :arg int/string buffer: 'line' will write lines as they are generated.
        Numbers indicate the number of bytes to buffer. Defaults to
        ``io.DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE``.
    :arg dict headers: HTTP headers to set on the response.
    :arg dict transform: (**TODO**)
        Transformations that should be applied to the files. The key matches a
        `glob pattern`_ (e.g. ``'*.md'`` or ``'data/*'``.) The value is a dict
        with the same structure as :class:`FunctionHandler`, and accepts these
        keys:

        ``encoding``
            The encoding to load the file as. If you don't specify an encoding,
            file contents are passed to ``function`` as a binary string.

        ``function``
            A string that resolves into any Python function or method (e.g.
            ``markdown.markdown``). By default, it is called with the file
            contents as ``function(content)`` and the result is rendered as-is
            (hence must be a string.)

        ``args``
            optional positional arguments to be passed to the function. By
            default, this is just ``['content']`` where ``content`` is the file
            contents. You can also pass the handler via ``['handler']``, or both
            of them in any order.

        ``kwargs``:
            an optional list of keyword arguments to be passed to the function.
            A value with of ``handler`` and ``content`` is replaced with the
            RequestHandler and file contents respectively.

        ``headers``:
            HTTP headers to set on the response.
